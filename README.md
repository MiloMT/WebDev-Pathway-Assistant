## Problem Definition

When beginning a learning journey in web development, there are innumerable resources, tools and pathways a person can use and undergo. This can lodge individuals in a state of indecision when trying to navigate the best way to learn. Not only this, but the information surrounding tooling in web development is spread across a variety of sources, making it difficult to track down information about the variety of tools available and enlarging the task of effective learning.

## Problem Reasoning

This problem creates a lack of clarity surrounding the learning process in web development. This can cause anxiety, lost time and effort and a lack of direction for those wishing to develop their skills further in this field.

This API intends to remedy the above by creating a single source of truth that users can utilise to plan their learning approach to web development. It contains information on a variety of web development tools and the tech stacks that utilise these tools. It can also generate a learning plan based on the users needs, and provide suggestions on time frames for users to dedicate to the task.
